# Scaling up epidemiological models with rule-based modelling

This is a collection of models as described in our paper,
[Scaling up epidemiological models with rule-based modelling].
They are written in the [Kappa language] and the models themselves
can be found in the [models/ subdirectory] of the repository on
the Github. It is also possible to simulate them in your web
browser with the links below:

* [Masks]
* [Fomites and hand-washing]
* [Vector-borne disease]
* [Testing]
* [Testing and contact tracing]
* [Schools as accelerants]
* [Gathering and superspreading]
